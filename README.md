ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @jjoluwasere

ðŸ’» DevOps Engineer | Automation & Infrastructure as Code | Finance-Aware Technologist

Iâ€™m a DevOps Engineer with a strong focus on systems automation, infrastructure as code, and scalable cloud-native architectures. With a background in Computer Science and Accounting and Finance, I bring a unique blend of business insight and technical expertise to my workâ€”especially in cost-sensitive, data-driven environments.

I specialise in building CI/CD pipelines, automating infrastructure using tools like Terraform and Docker, and enhancing observability through monitoring and alerting. I apply software engineering principles to operations, writing clean, maintainable code to provision, secure, and scale infrastructure.

Technical skills: Terraform, Docker, GitHub Actions, Python, Linux, SQL (MySQL), AWS, CI/CD.

Currently exploring: Java, Kubernetes, event-driven architectures, infrastructure security automation.

Iâ€™m particularly passionate about using DevOps to drive innovation in financial systemsâ€”automating deployments, improving compliance, and helping organisations deliver secure, cost-effective platforms.
